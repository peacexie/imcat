* mkv
 - There are 2-3 parts in the url after `?`, Separate by `.` or `-`, We called these parts `mkv`
 - Model and sub column Separate by `-`
 - Model and detail Separate by`.`
 - In this system, template configs and show data by mkv.

* m: model
 - The models(news,build) are defined at backend;
 - It can also be a custom model, Please see this entry `http://imcat.txjia.com/doc.php`:
 - ?start The home of `FastStart`(custom model)

* k: It stands for column id or detail id or custom-sub id
 - ?news-inner `inner` a column id in system
 - ?start-files `files`, files structure(custom-sub id)

* v: Extra-View-Parms
 - If only m in URL, That is the home of the model; of course, You can config a list template for it. At this point there are no V extra parameter
 - If only m and column id(custom-sub id)in URL, The default view is list, At this point there are no V extra parameter
 - If only shows details, The mkv should be m+id, like as `news.2015-a1-fhh1`, no V extra parameter
 - Some situations need to display complex content; Such as a building,  
   include a detail page, an ad. page,  
   a list of rent(rooms) page, a list of sale(rooms) page...  
   Now, this time, we must use more extra view parameters for shows these pages
