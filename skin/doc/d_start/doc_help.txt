* I am simple
 - The idea is simple: write the code, and share!
 - So use the free code hosting, free hosting space......
 - I am so happy and NOTHING worry about!

* One day, free code hosting shows the limit of XXX is over! (But before, it's show my PIONT Can be used for decades FREELY!)
 - So in a hurry, the code is transferred to another free code hosting site.
 - So think about it, how long(for FREE) will it take?
 - So to the internationalization, the next step will be put the code into the github.com hosting (It's slowly in China, but I think it more secure)

* One day, free hosting space, showing these message: [Server unavailable]
 - My God! so I change the demo website into baidu cloud......
 - Because of the charges, let me miss about the before free space, although a bit slow, the PHP version is slightly lower......
 - Because of the charges, My heart is dripping, here also thank for her free hosting providers before......

* No longer simple
 - 空间域名要收费，后续流量带宽需求高了云服务器要加价……
 - 测试微信接口，需要认证的服务号，要企业申请，要认证费用……
 - 测试各支付接口，有些要企业申请，要绑定银行账号……
 - 东西一旦发布，我一向不善美工，又需要美工资助……
 - …… …… ……
